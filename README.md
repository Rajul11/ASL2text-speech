# ASL2text-speech
## Overview  
This project focuses on the recognition of American Sign Language (ASL) gestures using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system is designed to identify static hand gestures corresponding to ASL letters or signs. The project consists of two main components: the deep learning-based gesture recognition model and the potential integration with real-time video or image processing systems.
